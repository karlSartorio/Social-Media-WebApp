# Social-Media-WebApp
After creating the very basic Django projects, it's time to develop a more complex web application that takes from the developed BLOG project and further goes from there. This Project involves creating a webapp, similar to reddit and creating a forum of forums. Where visitors can go to different forums, within the forum can see different posts and see post with many comments. Where users can create comments on a post,  posts in a single forum and even create a whole forum itself.
